Understand the data and variables:
       The adult dataset contains demographic and income information about individuals.
       Feature columns:
            1. age: The age of the individual.
            2.workclass: The employment sector of the individual.
            3.fnlwgt: Final weight,while doing servey. 
            4.education: Highest level of education acheived.
            5.education-num : Numerical version of education.
            6.marital-status: Marriage status.
            7.occupation: Type of occupation.
            8.relationship: Relationship status.
            9.race: The race of the individual.
           10.sex: The gender of the individual.
           11.capital-gain: Income from capital gains. 
           12.capital-loss:Income from capital loss. 
           13.hours-per-week: Number of hours worked per week.
           14.native-country: The country of origin.
     Target columns: income column contains values like <=50k and >50k.
  
     CategoricalVariables:workclass,education,marital-status,occupation,relationship,race,
                                           sex, and native-country.

     Numerical Variables:age,fnlwgt,education-num,capital-gain,capital-loss,hours-per-week.

     Target Variables:income.

     

Define Problem Statement:
    The task is to build a predictive  ML model that determines whether an employee earns more than 50k annually by analysing the given feature columns like demographic columns, job type, education level, and other columns.


Machine Learning Flow:
     1.Form a Hypothesis
     2.Collect and Explore the data
     3.Data cleaning and Preprocessing
     4.Data Splitting
     5.Model Selection
     6.Model Training
  7.Model Evaluation
  8.Hyperparameter Tuning
  9.Model Deployment
 10.Monitoring and Maintenance


About Dataset:
This is UCI Machine Learning Repositoryâ€™s Adult dataset. There are 4 files in the folder., adult.data : This is the main dataset file for ML model . This incudes demographic information with income variables for prediction.

Adult.names : This helps to understand the structure of dataset, includes attributes (feature names) and variables.

Adult.test : This is testing data used for validating  the ML model.

Index : 

Old.adult.names : This might be older version of structured dataset.

Objective of ML model :  To predict the people who make over $50k  per year based on all factors given.
